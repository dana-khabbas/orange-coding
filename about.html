     <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        Hi, my name is <strong>Dana</strong> and one of my favorite hobbies is <em>coding</em>, which I find both challenging and fun. 
        A quote that inspires me every day is <mark>"The only way to do great work is to love what you do."</mark> 
        I enjoy learning new things in science too; for instance, water has the chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O, 
        and I find math fascinating, like how x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>2</sup> explains the Pythagorean theorem. 
        In the past, I <del>rarely asked for help</del>, but now I <ins>collaborate more openly</ins> with others on projects.
    </p>

 Roses are red,
    Violets are blue,
        Coding is fun,
            And learning is too!
