   <h1> Petra</h1>
   <p>Inhabited since prehistoric times, this <strong> Nabataean </strong> caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea and the <strong>Dead Sea </strong>, was an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia. Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded
by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites, where ancient <strong> Eastern </strong> traditions blend with <strong>Hellenistic</strong> architecture.</p>
